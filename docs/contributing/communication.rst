Github Communication Tips
==========================

- Don't be afraid to mention people (@username) who are knowledgeable on the topic or invested.  *We are academics and overcommitted, it's too easy for issues to go unanswered: don't give up on us!*
- Likewise, don't be shy about bumping an issue if no one responds after a few days. *Balancing responsibilities is hard.*
- Want to get more involved? Issues marked with "Good beginner issue" are a good place to start if you want to try your hand at submitting a PR.
- Everyone is encouraged/welcome to comment on the issue queue! Tell us if you
    - are experiencing the same problem
    - have tried a suggested fix
    - know of a potential solution or work-around
    - have an opinion, idea or feedback of any kind!
- Be kind when interacting with others on Github! (see Code of Conduct below for further guidelines). We want to foster a welcoming, inclusive community!
    - Constructive criticism is welcome and encouraged but should be worded such that it is helpful :-) Direct criticism towards the idea or solution rather than the person and focus on alternatives or improvements.
